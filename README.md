# Piano Hall VR
Piano Hall VR is a Seated VR experience where you can use your fingers to play piano notes on an oversized piano.

To play on the piano, simply press the keys using your controller. The keys are pressure sensitive and will play louder notes if you press with a higher velocity.

# Pre-requisites
The experience is built using SteamVR. Make sure your headset supports it.
